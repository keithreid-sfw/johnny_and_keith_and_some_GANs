open source fun pertaining to generative adversarial networks

using certain principles from nature to design gnarly AI
principles include:
    AIs that have their own wants and needs in a physically situated world
    AIs that breed
    quasiautonomous networks to mimc the effcts of e.g. basal ganglia
    use of like anatomical not computing terms: afferent and efferent not input and putput
    monsters, fires, prey
    singing
    emotional states
    sight, hearing, insight
    aim to move from singing to discussing human feeling
      
cool stuff:
    TDD all the way
    use only Float32 numbers cos they go into GPUs better
    GPUs
    lame ASCII graphics
    the adversarial bit is sometimes collaborative
